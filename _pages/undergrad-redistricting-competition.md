Announcing...the 2023-2024 Undergraduate OR Redistricting Competition!

- First prize is $1,000 in travel support to attend the 2024 INFORMS Annual Meeting and compete for the [INFORMS Undergraduate Operations Research Prize](https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/INFORMS-Prizes/Undergraduate-Operations-Research-Prize) (whose deadline is usually June 30th).
- Instructors of undergrad OR courses in fall 2023 or spring 2024 are invited to use redistricting as a course project and nominate one team (by May 31, 2024).
- Judges will have approximately two weeks (June 1-15, 2024) to score the submissions and select the winner.
- The winner will be notified around June 16, 2024, giving them two weeks to finalize their submission for the INFORMS Undergrad OR Prize.
- [This GitHub repo](https://github.com/AustinLBuchanan/Districting-Examples-2020) gives some example districting codes. Near the bottom are links to previous student projects.
